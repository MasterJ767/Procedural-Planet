# Procedural-Planet

## How to Use

Opening the project in unity and navigating to the scene titled "Worlds" is the best starting point. This scene contains a wide variety of sample planets and should give you an idea of how the planets can be created an manipulated.

There is a link to a video demonstration of the project [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWFOQajerE0&ab_channel=JonathanArundel).
